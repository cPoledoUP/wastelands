# Macroeconomics
## What is Macroeconomics
- analysis dealing with the behavior of the **economy as a whole** with respect to **output, income, the price level, foreign trade, unemployment, and other economic aggregate variables**
- models are developed to explain the relationship between factors such as **national income, output, consumption, unemployment, inflation, savings, investment, international trade, and international finance**
## Measuring the Value of Economic Activity
### Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
- market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time
- measures two things at once: **total income** of everyone in the economy and **total expenditure** on the economy's output of goods and services
- GDP = C + I + G + NX
	- C = Consumption
	- I = Investment
	- G = Government Purchases
	- NX = Net Exports
### Gross National Income (GNI)
- GDP **plus** income earned by **domestic residents through foreign investments** **minus** the income earned by **foreign investors in the domestic market** aka **Net Primary Income (NPI)** from the Rest of the World
- GNI = GDP + NPI
	- GDP = Gross Domestic Product
	- NPI = Net Primary Income
## Government and Foreign Agents

1. **Government purchases of goods and services**
	- transactions for which government makes payments to firms
2. **Government payments for factor services**
	- payments of government to the owners of the factors of production
	- e.g., salary of public school teacher
3. **Transfer of payments between different agents**
	- transactions wherein one party is not to deliver a good or service in return for the payment
	- e.g., retirement benefits, donations
4. **Firms and household pay taxes to the government**
	- payments from the households and firms to the government
	- e.g., taxes
5. **Transactions with foreign investors**
	- transactions between foreign and domestic agents
## Approaches to GDP Measurement
### Nominal GDP
- production of goods and services valued at current prices
### Real GDP
- production of goods and services valued at constant prices
### GDP Deflator
- measures the current level of prices relative to the level of prices in the base year
- GDP Deflator = (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) x 100
## National Income and Welfare
- **GDP per capita (per person)** is often used as a measure of a person's welfare
- limitations
	- **exclude** unpaid economic activity, e.g., **domestic work such as childcare**
	- **no account of the inputs used to produce the output**
	- comparison of GDP from one country to another may be **distorted by movements in exchange rates**
	- **does not measure factors that affect quality of life**, e.g., environment and security
	- **mean wealth** instead of **median wealth**
# Introducing Government and Foreign Agents
## Approaches to GDP Measurement
### Expenditure Approach
- involves calculating the sum of all expenditures of final goods
- GDP = C + I + G + NX
#### Components
- **Personal Consumption (C)**
	- spending of household and non-profit institutions on goods and services
	- **non-durables**: consumed rapidly (e.g, foods, beverages, and services)
	- **durables goods**: last for a longer period of time (e.g., furniture and appliances)
- **Gross Domestic Capital Formation (I)**
	- investment spending of domestic agents
	- **changes in** fixed capital and stocks
- **Government Expenditures (G)**
	- total value of goods and services purchased by the government
	- key components:
		1. **Public Administration**: salaries and benefits of government employees, etc.
		2. **Defense and Security**: military personnel salaries, defense equipment, etc.
		3. **Education**: teacher salaries, school development, educational materials, etc.
		4. **Healthcare**: salaries of healthcare workers, medical supplies, etc.
		5. **Infrastructure Maintenance and Development**: maintenance of public infrastructure such as roads, etc.
		6. **Social Welfare Programs**: providing assistance to vulnerable groups of society in forms of cash, subsidies, insurance, etc.
		7. **Other Government Operations**: miscellaneous government expenditures not covered by the above categories
- **Net Export (NX)**
	- difference between the value of a country's exports versus its imports
	- **Exports (X)**: represents spending of the rest of the world on goods and non-factor services produced in the Philippines
	- **Imports (M)**: represents the country's purchases of goods and non-factor services from the rest of the world. it is subtracted as these do not represent domestic production
- **Net Primary Income (NPI)**
	- difference between the earnings of Philippine residents in other countries and foreign residents in the Philippines
	- crucial indicator for assessing the country's economic relationships and dependency on foreign investments
- **Statistical Discrepancy**
	- captures reporting and recording errors that cause the GDP estimates of the three approaches to differ from each other
### Income Approach
- calculates GDP by taking the sum of the payments for the different factors of production
- total of all income from **wages, interest, profits, and rent (a.k.a. Gross Domestic Income (GDI)**
- GDP = GDI + Indirect tax - Subsidies - Depreciation
#### Components
- **Wages and Salaries**
	- includes compensation paid to employees for their labor
- **Profits**
	- income earned by businesses after deducting expenses such as wages, rent, and taxes
- **Rent**
	- income earned by owners of land an other natural resources for their use
- **Interest**
	- income earned by owners of capital (such as interest on loans)
- Gross Domestic Income = wages + interest + profits + rent
- **Depreciation**
	- represents the consumption of existing capital stock
- **Indirect Taxes less Subsidies**
### Industrial Origin or Value Added Approach
- contribution of the different factors of production to value of a good
- value added = sales - purchases from other firms
#### Components
##### Agriculture, Fishery, and Forestry Sector
- or simply agriculture sector
1. **Crop production**: includes the value of output such as rice, corn, etc.
2. **Livestock and Poultry**: encompasses value of output such as meat, eggs, etc.
3. **Fisheries**: value of output from capture fisheries, aquaculture, etc.
4. **Forestry and Logging**: value of output from timber harvesting, wood processing, etc., as well as conservation of forest ecosystems
5. **Agricultural Services and Support Activities**: includes agricultural machinery, irrigation services, etc.
6. **Agro-processing and Value-Added Activities**: includes the value of output from food processing, beverage manufacturing, etc.
##### Industry Sector
- value added of firms engaged in mining and quarrying, manufacturing, utilities, and construction
1. **Manufacturing**: electronics and semiconductor industry, food and beverage processing, etc.
2. **Construction**: residential, commercial, etc.
3. **Mining and Quarry**: metallic and non-metallic minerals, etc.
4. **Utilities**: electricity generation and distribution, water supply, etc.
##### Service Sector
- made up of the following subsectors:
	1. wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles
	2. transportation and storage activities
	3. information and communication
	4. financial and insurance activities
	5. real estate and ownership of dwellings
	6. professional and business services
	7. public administration and defense, compulsory social activities
	8. education
	9. human health and social work activities
	10. other services
# Related Measures of Output
- real GDP reflect only changes in the amounts being produced
- real GDP is a measure of economy's production of goods and services
- in making comparisons across countries, the practice is to convert GDP or GNI into a common currency, usually in US dollars
	- Exchange rate = the price of foreign currency
	- PH GNI in US Dollars = GNI in Pesos / Exchange rate
- it also makes sense to use per capita estimates to eliminate differences in population size
- **caution**: using exchange rate to convert GNP to US dollars can lead to misleading conclusion as the cost of purchasing a given bundle of goods in unlikely to be the same for different countries
# Consumer Price Index (CPI)
- indicator of the change in the average prices of a fixed basket of goods and services commonly purchased by households relative to a base year
- most widely used in the calculation of the **inflation rate** and **purchasing power** of the peso
	- changes in CPI over a specific period of time is **the rate of inflation**
## Components
- **market basket**: list of commodities or goods and services commonly purchased by households
- **weight**: values attached to the commodities or groups of commodities to indicate their relative importance in the market basket
- **base year or base period**: reference period, at which the index number is set to 100
- **index computation methodology**: PSA uses **Chained Laspeyres Formula**
## Market Basket
- **CPI market basket** represent the composite price behavior of all goods and services purchased by consumers
- 2018 Philippine CPI uses a basket of goods and services that includes **487 items**
## Sample Outlets
- prices of goods and services are collected from sample retail outlets or stores
- criteria:
	- store should be popular or is a well-known seller of the items to be priced
	- store should have a consistent stock of commodities to be priced
	- store should have permanent physical location
	- store should be accessible to a greater segment of the population
## Calculating the CPI
1. Identify base year
2. fix the basket
3. find the prices
4. determine household consumption patterns (weights)
5. compute the basket's cost
6. compute the CPI

## Inflation Rate (IR)
- annual rate of change or year-on-year change in CPI
- $IR = \frac{CPI_n - CPI_o}{CPI_o} \times 100$
	- $CPI_n$ = current month's index for all items
	- $CPI_o$ = same moth last year's index for all items
## Core Inflation
- measures the change in average consumer prices **excluding certain items in the CPI with volatile price movements**
- excludes **29.6% of the CPI items** as follows: cereals, meat, diesel, gasoline, etc.
- measure of underlying long-term inflation and indicator of future inflation
## Headline Inflation
- mostly reported by the government and the media
## Purchasing Power of the Peso
- shows how much the peso in the base period is worth in another period
- indication of the real value of the peso in a given period relative to its value in a base period
- inflation is equivalent to a decline in the purchasing power of peso
- computed by getting the reciprocal of the CPI
- purchasing power of the peso = 1 / CPI x 100
