# Module 7 - Functions: Properties, Types, and Applications
## Introduction
- a **function** can be considered as a **machine** or **operator**
- takes an input $x$, do something on the input, and produce an output $f(x)$
## What is a function?
- a function $f$ from $X$ to $Y$ ($f: X \rightarrow Y$) is a relation from $X$ to $Y$ wherein every $x$ in Set $X$ is associated to **one element** $y$ in Set $Y$ by a rule $f$
	- Set $X$ is called the **domain of $f$**
	- Set $Y$ is called the **range of $f$**
## Types of Functions
1. **Constant Function**
	- $f(x) = c$
	- any input $x$ will yield the same output $c$
	- technically a linear function with zero slope
